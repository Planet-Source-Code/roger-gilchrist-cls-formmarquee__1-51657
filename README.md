### Description

Inspired by 'An old-fashioned Billboard Marquee' txtCodeId=51571 which is good looking but not very portable I built this class. I have always felt that if you need a large number of controls you should use the 'Load' command not painstakingly apply over a hundred controls. If you change resolution this can be very painful to upgrade. This class simple creates (and deletes) controls on the fly using just one indexed Image control as a seed. If you make a large change in the size of the marquee there is a slight delay. The screenshot doesn't really tell you much (no movement) just imagine all the little disks (yellow dots) moving
